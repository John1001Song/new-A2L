				<strong>Phishing scam/attack targeted specifically at the Avenue to Learn community</strong><br /><br />
				<ul>
					<li>There is an advanced spear-phishing attack ongoing against our community, and they’re using Avenue to Learn as their bait.
						<br /><br />
						The attackers have created a site that looks identical to the Avenue login site, and baited users to go there with a password expiry notice.
						<br /><br />
						Please note that the Avenue to Learn team does not ever send out emails regarding password resets, and if users are ever unsure, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support.avenue@cll.mcmaster.ca">support.avenue@cll.mcmaster.ca</a> and we'll be happy to respond to any concerns that you may have.

<strong>Digital Badges</strong><br /><br />
<ul>
	<li>A new tool will be appearing on Avenue today: Badges. Digital badges are a way to document skills, experiences and achievements. Digital badges are portable through Mozilla's Backpack, and allow the user to combine badges from different sources to better articulate themselves to an audience on almost any digital platform. For more information, please see our <a href="https://wiki.mcmaster.ca/avenue/badges" target="_new">support wiki article on badges</a>.
		<br /><br />
		If you are interested in issuing badges in a curricular or co-curricular context, please get in touch with Jon Kruithof, <a href="mailto:kruithj@mcmaster.ca">kruithj@mcmaster.ca</a>
